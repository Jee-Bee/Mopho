MOPHO UI
========

Project Introduduction
----------------------

I have some hardware synts and one of them is the [Dave Smith Mopho](https://www.sequential.com/product/mopho/ "Dave Smith Mopho"). For some time i don't use it quite often in favor of some digital (modular-)sysnts.
After upgrading to a new OSX version i figured out that the software i used before ([mopho LE editor](https://www.soundtower.com/mopho/ "mopho LE editor")) is not working.
Initial i leaved it that way for some time and now i am thinking about getting a bit more experience in programming i decided that this looks like as a interesting project.

Installation
------------

- python
- one or more midi libraries
- Qt / PySide

Status
------

Curent status can only be descibed as pre-alpha status.
I don't give a time schedule about how and when it is finished!
